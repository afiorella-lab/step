Repository for all of the games we program in the Adelphi STEP Program.
This repository holds all of the games that I have worked on/taught in Adelphi University's STEP program.
There are "Starter" files, which contain all of the starting code & assets we have given out at the start of 
the lesson, and "Final" files, which contain the version of the game that we completed by the end of class.
